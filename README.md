# Coding_and_Data_Management_University_Project

**Introduction**

The project will focus on an analysis of **Fortune 1000** companies. In particular on Fortune 1000 list of 2022.

The Fortune 1000 are the 1000 largest American companies ranked by revenues for a specific year, as compiled by the magazine Fortune. The list only includes companies which are incorporated or authorized to do business in the United States, and for which revenues are publicly available. There are various types of companies coming from many different sectors and with different dimensions, from Big Tech companies such as Apple and Amazon to small companies.

While this list includes numerous prominent and highly successful companies in the country, it is important to note that it is not a flawless measure of success. Only publicly traded companies are considered, which means many privately-held businesses are excluded. Additionally, the list primarily relies on revenue generation rather than profitability as a criterion for inclusion.


**Research Questions**

I will focus on different topics and factors related to Fortune 1000 companies, trying to answer the following research questions.

Financial performances and sectors analysis:
- Which companies generate the highest revenues? Which sector dominates the Fortune 1000 list in terms of the number of companies and revenues?
- Are companies profitable? Is there a relationship with revenues? How is the profitability of companies distributed overall? 
- How do different sectors within the Fortune 500 compare in terms of financial performance metrics, such as profit margins and return on assets (ROA)?
- Do revenues depend on the number of employees?

Focus on the geographical dimension:
- How are headquarters of Fortune 1000 companies distributed across the United States?
- Which states generate the highest revenues? Is there a correlation between population, state GDP, state unemployment and the number of Fortune 1000 companies?

Company policies:
- Do companies with founder CEOs or female CEOs exhibit better financial performance compared to other companies?


**Datasets choice**

In order to answer to the different research questions, I have selected various datasets from different sources.

*Fortune 2022 Dataset* is the main dataset for this project. I downloaded it from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/winston56/fortune-500-data-2021). The source seems reliable because the dataset is created through web scraping of the Fortune official website.

*Fortune 2022 second Dataset* is a secondary dataset that has some additional columns referring to the Fortune 1000 list that can be added to the main dataset. The source is always Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramjasmaurya/fortune-1000-companieslatest) and the dataset is created through scraping of the Fortune website.

*US GDP by State Dataset* is a dataset that contains the data for GDP (Gross Domestic Product) for each state of the United States in 2021. The source is the BEA (Bureau of Economic Analysis), an official United States government source (https://shorturl.at/bzHNX).

*US States Abbreviations Dataset* is includes abbreviations for each state of the United States. Source (Kaggle): https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/giodev11/usstates-dataset?select=state-abbrevs.csv.

*US Unemployment Rates by State Dataset* is a dataset that contains unemployment rates from 2017 to 2021. Source (Kaggle): https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pasicebear/us-unemployment-rates-per-state-20172021?select=unemployment_rates.csv.

*US Population by State Dataset* is a dataset that has US population datas by state from 2020 to 2022. The source is the United States Census Bureau: https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2020s-state-total.html.
